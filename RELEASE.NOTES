- [feature] support for mysql as database
- [feature] prevent users from login after N failed attempts
- [feature] revocation of access tokens
  It is now possible to revoke access tokens by using the following service
  endpoints:
  * auth-server/token/revocation
    For revocation of the access token sent as bearer token in the
    Authorization header
  * auth-server/token/revocation/<uuid of user>
    For revocation of all access tokens that were issued to or in behalf of a
    given user. This endpoint is protected.
- [feature] revoke all access tokens of a deactivated/deleted user
- [enhancement] Force UTF-8 encoding of requests and responses
- [enhancement] better error message on search
  When searching for resources and forgetting the surrounding double quotes for
  values, a non-understandable error message was responded. the error message
  was changed to explicitly tell that the error occurred due to missing
  double quotes.

  Spring Metrics 3.0.2, Jackson 2.4.2, Hibernate 4.3.6, AspectJ 1.8.2,
